# Project Experience

## What Worked Well
- **Voice Recognition**: The speech-to-text conversion worked reliably for common phrases.
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright successfully controlled browser actions such as opening, refreshing, and closing tabs.
- **Logging & Configuration**: Using Pydantic for validation ensured that the TOML and YAML configurations were correctly structured.
- **Task Automation with Just**: The use of `just` made project setup and execution more streamlined.

## Challenges Faced
- **Accurate Speech Recognition**: Some commands were misinterpreted, requiring additional debugging.
- **System Permissions**: Adjusting system settings like brightness and Caps Lock required special permissions on different operating systems.
- **Integration with External APIs**: Automating web searches and retrieving job listings required handling dynamic page structures.

## Lessons Learned
- **Validation is Key**: Using Pydantic for configuration validation prevented a lot of potential errors.
- **Debugging is Essential**: Logging played a crucial role in debugging misinterpreted voice commands.
- **Automation Improves Productivity**: Automating tasks via voice commands can greatly improve efficiency and user experience.

## Future Improvements
- Improve command recognition by implementing NLP-based enhancements.
- Enhance user customization by allowing more flexible command mappings.
- Add support for more hardware actions such as volume control and Wi-Fi toggling.
