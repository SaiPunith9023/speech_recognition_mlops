# Voice Command System

Welcome to the **Voice Command System** documentation. This project allows users to execute various system and web automation tasks using voice commands. The system integrates **speech recognition**, **browser automation**, **hardware control**, and **robotic process automation (RPA)** into a seamless experience.

## Key Features
- **Application Control**: Open/close browsers, navigate to websites, and manage browser tabs.
- **Hardware Control**: Adjust system brightness, move the mouse, toggle Caps Lock, and take screenshots.
- **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)**: Automate web tasks like searching Google, logging into Moodle, and checking the weather.
- **Logging & Configurations**: Uses `Pydantic` for validation, `Loguru` for logging, and structured configurations via `TOML` and `YAML`.

## Quick Start
1. **Set up the environment**:
    ```bash
    just setup
    ```
2. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    just run
    ```
3. **Give voice commands** and watch the system perform tasks automatically!

Refer to the `Features` and `Architecture` sections for more details.
